# COMPUTER SCIENCE KEYWORDS
# What is Computer Science?
The study of computers and computational systems, including the theory, design, and development of software. Computer scientists focus on software and software systems, and work with mathematical models, data analysis, and security.
# Computation
A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.

# RISC- V
stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) and the “V” represents the fifth version of the RISC architecture. Unlike proprietary architectures such as ARM and x86, RISC-V is an open standard, allowing anyone to implement it without the need for licensing fees.
# CISC
A complex instruction set computer (CISC /ˈsɪsk/) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.
# ASIC
computer chips that combine several different circuits all on one chip – it's a "system-on-a-chip" (SoC) design – allowing it to be custom programmed to combine several related functions that together carry out a specific overall task.
# OPERATING SYSTEM 
software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

# Storage
A hard disk drive or solid state drive holds all of the data; files, photos, programs, music, and movies, that the user wants to keep. Removable, external media storage devices such as flash drives and read/writeable CDs and DVDs are also secondary storage. A computer can't function without a storage drive, however.
